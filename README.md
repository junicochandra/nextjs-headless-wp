# Headless WordPress Portfolio with Next.js

This is my personal portfolio project built with **Next.js 15** as the frontend and **WordPress (GraphQL)** as the headless CMS backend.  
The project demonstrates how to integrate WordPress data with a modern React-based framework for a fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly website.
